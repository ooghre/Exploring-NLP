# Exploring-NLP
This project is a small project examining Natural language processing and machine learning in python

It uses a data set comprising of Questions from stack overflow and a label column compring of the intent behind those questions.
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model (using RAndom forest algorithm) that predicts the intent of a question given the dataset
